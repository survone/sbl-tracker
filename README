SBL Tracker - a tool to keep track of company's IP's listed at SpamHaus

INTRO

This is a quick and dirty web-based app to help ISP's abuse team keep track 
of IP's listed at SpamHaus: it fetches entries from SBL and stores them in 
the local DB allowing to associate an entry with a customer or company's 
sub-divisions, add comments, etc.

REQUIREMENTS

PHP 5.3.x with mysqli
MySQL 5.x
may work with other PHP versions, but hasn't been tested

INSTALLATION

1) upload the files to the web server
2) create a database
3) use the create-table.sql SQL file to create tables
4) edit config.php and supply the MySQL connection details, 
   link to fetch SBL entries and other info
5) create ACL's in .htaccess as the app doesn't provide any authentication

TODO

At the moment I have no plans to develop it further,
initially it was planned to add several other black lists.
